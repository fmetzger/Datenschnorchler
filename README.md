Datenschnorchler
================

This is a simple Android application, which gathers all data from your phone's call and sms log and all entries from your phone book and writes them into csv style files on your phone's sd card.

The project structure was generated by Android Studio and should (hopefully) be able to be imported directly back into Android Studio.

All code is public domain.
